## COM6012 Scalable Machine Learning - University of Sheffield

### Spring 2022 by [Haiping Lu](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/H.Lu/) and [Mauricio A √Ålvarez](https://maalvarezl.github.io/)

In [this module](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/intranet/teaching/public/modules/msc/com6012.html), we will learn how to do machine learning at large scale using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).
We will use the [High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster systems](https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/hpc/index.html) of our university. If you are NOT on the University's network, you **must** use [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/vpn) to connect to the HPC.

This edition uses [**PySpark 3.2.1**](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.1/api/python/index.html#), the [latest stable release of Spark](https://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-0-1.html) (Jan 26, 2022), and has 10 sessions below. You can refer to the [overview slides](https://github.com/haipinglu/ScalableML/blob/master/Slides/Overview-COM6012-2022.pdf) for more information, e.g. timetable and assessment information.

* Session 1: Introduction to Spark and HPC
* Session 2: RDD, DataFrame, ML pipeline, & parallelization
* Session 3: Scalable decision trees and ensemble models
* Session 4: Scalable logistic regression
* Session 5: Scalable generalized linear models
* Session 6: Scalable neural networks
* Session 7: Scalable matrix factorisation for collaborative filtering in recommender systems
* Session 8: Scalable k-means clustering and Spark configuration
* Session 9: Scalable PCA for dimensionality reduction and Spark data types
* Session 10: Apache Spark in the Cloud (guest lecture by [Dr Michael Smith)](http://www.michaeltsmith.org.uk/?page_id=11)

You can also download the [Spring 2021 version](https://github.com/haipinglu/ScalableML/archive/refs/tags/v2021.zip) for preview or reference.
